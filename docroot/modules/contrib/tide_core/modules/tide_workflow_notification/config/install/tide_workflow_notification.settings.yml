      Hi [workflow-notification:recipient:display-name],

      The status of the web content [node:title] - [node:url] has changed from Draft to Needs review.

      Please review this content and check:

      • it meets our standards and style guide https://www.vic.gov.au/how-publish-content-vicgovau
      • it is factually accurate

      If it does not meet standards, provide feedback to the Content editor [user:display-name] by return email and change the status back to Draft.
      If it meets standards, change the status in the CMS to Published and click Apply.
      NOTE: Always check the publishing date. If content has a scheduled publish date, don't change it inadvertently.

      Hi [workflow-notification:recipient:display-name],

      The status of your web content at [node:title] - [node:url] has changed from Archive pending to Archived. This is because:
      • your approver approved your request to archive it
      • the content had a scheduled archive date

      You should also ensure all menu links and navigation links to the page are removed.

      When a page is archived, it is no longer available to view on the internet, but SDP CMS users can still find it. If you have reason to make sure noone can access a page, you should request to have the content deleted from the CMS.
